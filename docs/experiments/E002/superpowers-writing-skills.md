## Writing SKILL.md

A skill's `description` says only when to use it: triggering conditions and
symptoms, starting with "Use when...". It never summarizes the skill's
workflow, because an agent that reads a workflow summary follows it instead
of reading the skill.

When you write or change a skill's frontmatter, name or description, or
need to cut its size, read [references/discovery.md](https://github.com/obra/superpowers/blob/v7.0.2/skills/writing-skills/references/discovery.md):
the SKILL.md template, description and keyword guidance, naming, token
budgets, and cross-referencing other skills.

Before writing guidance, classify the baseline failure. The form that bulletproofs one failure type measurably backfires on another.

| Baseline failure | Right form | Wrong form |
|---|---|---|
| Skips/violates a rule under pressure (knows better, does it anyway) | Prohibition + rationalization table + red flags (see references/bulletproofing.md) | Soft guidance ("prefer...", "consider...") |
| Complies, but output has the wrong shape (bloated prompt, buried verdict, restated spec) | Positive recipe or contract: state what the output IS — its parts, in order | Prohibition list ("don't restate", "never narrate") |
| Omits a required element from something they already produce | Structural: REQUIRED field or slot in the template they fill in | Prose reminders near the template |
| Behavior should depend on a condition | Conditional keyed to an observable predicate ("if the brief exists, reference it") | Unconditional rule + exemption clauses |

**Why prohibitions backfire on shaping problems:** under a competing incentive ("make the prompt self-contained"), agents negotiate with "don't X". In head-to-head wording tests on dispatch-prompt guidance, the prohibition arm produced clearly more of the unwanted content than the recipe arm (fully separated distributions), and trended worse than even the no-guidance control — micro-test your own case rather than assuming, but never reach for the prohibition by default. A recipe leaves nothing to negotiate: the output matches the stated shape or it doesn't.

**Rules for whichever form you pick:**
- **No nuance clauses.** "Don't X unless it matters" reopens the negotiation — appending a single nuance clause to a winning recipe degraded it from consistent to noisy in the same wording tests. Express a real exception as its own conditional on an observable predicate.
- **Exemption clauses don't scope.** "This limit doesn't apply to code blocks" still suppresses code blocks. If part of the output must be exempt, restructure so the rule can't reach it.

## Bulletproofing Against Rationalization

When the baseline failure is a discipline failure, read
[references/bulletproofing.md](https://github.com/obra/superpowers/blob/v7.0.2/skills/writing-skills/references/bulletproofing.md) before you write
the guidance: closing loopholes, the spirit-vs-letter line, the
rationalization table, and the red-flags list.

## RED-GREEN-REFACTOR for Skills

Follow the TDD cycle:

### RED: Write Failing Test (Baseline)

Run pressure scenario with subagent WITHOUT the skill. Document exact behavior:
- What choices did they make?
- What rationalizations did they use (verbatim)?
- Which pressures triggered violations?

This is "watch the test fail" - you must see what agents naturally do before writing the skill.

### GREEN: Write Minimal Skill

Write skill that addresses those specific rationalizations. Don't add extra content for hypothetical cases.

Run same scenarios WITH skill. Agent should now comply.

### REFACTOR: Close Loopholes

Agent found new rationalization? Add explicit counter. Re-test until bulletproof.

### Micro-Test Wording Before Full Scenarios

Full pressure-scenario runs are the final gate, but they are slow and expensive per iteration. Verify the wording itself first with micro-tests:

1. **One fresh-context sample per call** — a raw API call, or a single-shot subagent if you don't have API access. System prompt = the realistic context the guidance will live in (the full skill or prompt template, not the guidance in isolation); user message = a task that tempts the failure.
2. **Always include a no-guidance control.** If the control doesn't exhibit the failure, there is nothing to fix — stop, don't author the guidance.
3. **5+ reps per variant.** Single samples lie.
4. **Manually read every flagged match.** Score programmatically if you like, but template echoes and quoted counter-examples masquerade as hits; automated counts alone overstate both failure and success.
5. **Variance is a metric.** When guidance lands, reps converge on the same shape. Five different interpretations across five reps means the wording isn't binding — tighten the form before adding words.

Micro-tests verify wording; they do not replace pressure scenarios for discipline skills.

**Testing methodology:** See [references/testing-skills-with-subagents.md](https://github.com/obra/superpowers/blob/v7.0.2/skills/writing-skills/references/testing-skills-with-subagents.md) for the complete testing methodology:

### 1. Rich Description Field

**Purpose:** Your agent reads the description to decide which skills to load for a given task. Make it answer: "Should I read this skill right now?"

**Format:** Start with "Use when..." to focus on triggering conditions

**CRITICAL: Description = When to Use, NOT What the Skill Does**

The description should ONLY describe triggering conditions. Do NOT summarize the skill's process or workflow in the description.

**Why this matters:** Testing revealed that when a description summarizes the skill's workflow, an agent may follow the description instead of reading the full skill content. A description saying "code review between tasks" caused an agent to do ONE review, even though the skill's flowchart clearly showed TWO reviews (spec compliance then code quality).

When the description was changed to just "Use when executing implementation plans with independent tasks" (no workflow summary), the agent correctly read the flowchart and followed the two-stage review process.

**The trap:** Descriptions that summarize workflow create a shortcut agents will take. The skill body becomes documentation agents skip.

```yaml
# ❌ BAD: Summarizes workflow - agents may follow this instead of reading skill
description: Use when executing plans - dispatches subagent per task with code review between tasks

# ❌ BAD: Too much process detail
description: Use for TDD - write test first, watch it fail, write minimal code, refactor

# ✅ GOOD: Just triggering conditions, no workflow summary
description: Use when executing implementation plans with independent tasks in the current session

# ✅ GOOD: Triggering conditions only
description: Use when implementing any feature or bugfix, before writing implementation code
```
